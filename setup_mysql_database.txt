The Ioc log server needs a running instance of MySQl - see CSS/ArchiveEngine/setup_mysql_database.txt to install MySQl if
it is not already done this

Once mysql is started, you need to load log_mysql_schema.txt from this directory

from a command prompt run:

    mysql -u root -p < log_mysql_schema.txt

and when prompted for a password give the MySQl admin password you previous set
